# Fork metadata

This version of updns is being bashed into a server suitable to play a part in
<https://github.com/chrysn/provisioning-demo>.

Short of trivial fixes (which may be cherry-picked), it is not expected that
any of this makes sense to propose for upstreaming into updns; most changes
will add hard-coded behavior. On the long run, it is open whether a later
production ready equivalent of the current demo will better be based on this
updns fork (with most components, including upstreaming and explicit
configuration, being stripped out), or whether a new component will be
developed from scratch -- but for now, adding a few hard-coded paths into updns
seems to be most practical.

updns is a simple DNS proxy server developed using `Rust`. You can intercept any domain name and return the ip you need

## Install

[Download](https://github.com/wyhaya/updns/releases) the binary from the release page

Or use `cargo` to install

```bash
cargo install updns
```

## Start to use ðŸš€

```bash
updns
# or
updns -c /your/hosts
```

You may use `sudo` to run this command because you will use the `53` port

## Running in docker

Build docker image
```bash
docker build -t updns .
```

Start up
```bash
docker run -d --name updns -p 53:53/udp -v /root/updns/:/root/.updns/ --restart always updns
```

## Config

You can use `updns config` command and then call `vim` edit, or find `~/.updns/config`  edit

You can specify standard domains, or utilize [regular expressions](https://rustexp.lpil.uk "rustexp") for dynamic matching

> Regular expression starts with `~`

```ini
bind     0.0.0.0:53      # Binding address
proxy    8.8.8.8:53      # Proxy address
timeout  2s              # Proxy timeout (format: 1ms, 1s, 1m, 1h, 1d)

# Domain matching
example.com              1.1.1.1
*.example.com            2.2.2.2
~^\w+\.example\.[a-z]+$  3.3.3.3

# IPv6
test.com                ::

# Import from other file
import /other/hosts
```
